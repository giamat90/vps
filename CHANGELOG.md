Releases before 0.1.62 are not itemised; see `git log` and the tags.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- A "Panels" menu in the practice-room header: tick which panels to show (Takes, Lyrics, Piano roll, Spectrum comparison, Dynamics, Vibrato, Timing, Coach), or Show all / Hide all / Reset. Your choice is remembered. The spectrum comparison, dynamics and timing views now start hidden.
- The practice room is one vertical column: the right-hand sidebar is gone. Takes sit under the waveforms and the vibrato, timing and coach cards under the pitch views, so hiding a panel gives its space back.

### Changed
- The "Analysis" tab is gone: the piano roll is a panel like the others and no longer opens or closes by itself when you select a take or record.
- Takes are loaded when a song opens, whether or not the Takes panel is shown.

## [0.1.64] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Pitch detection no longer needs to be chosen: the "Pitch detection algorithm" selector is gone from Settings and the app always uses SRH, the algorithm that rated best in our A/B tests. Anyone who had picked another algorithm moves to SRH; songs already in the library keep the pitch curve they were analysed with until re-imported.

## [0.1.63] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Shared code (metronome, recorder, timeline zoom/pan, auto-update, lyrics engine, yt-dlp version check) now comes from the shared `mps-core` package, which both apps use. No change in behaviour is intended.

## [0.1.62] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Synced lyrics panel in the practice room: forced alignment of lyrics to the vocals stem, LRCLIB lookup, word-level highlighting.
- Monitor button works while a Free Exercise take or file is loaded, so you can sing against the loaded track without recording.
- Automated test suites (vitest, cargo, pytest) run in CI on every push and pull request.

### Fixed
- The time readout and lyrics now follow a waveform click while playback is paused.
- The practice room no longer shows a spurious "No audio loaded" label when a song load was superseded by a newer one.
- Test-suite review fixes: double audio-offset skip, stale punch region, orphaned job directories.
